1. Star Rating - the average rating of the product will be displayed in the format of solid or outlined stars, where the solid stars represents the review score. A total of 5 stars should always appear, and the amount filled in should correspond to the average score.

2. The visual for rating should be representative of up to a quarter of a review point.  For example, if the average is 3.8, this should display as 3¾ solid stars and 1¼ outlined stars.  If there are no reviews, this entire section should be hidden.

High Level Plan:
1. Get average score (up to .25) of current product.
  // get product ID
  // Reviews API request
  // results array will hold all reviews for the product, iterate through and get the average (round to 0.25 of a point)

2. Render solid stars based on average.
   How to do this? Gradient? fill
   example: average is 3

   # of whole numbers = Math.floor(average)
   Remainder = Average - Math.floor(average)

   Scale:
   0.01 - 0.33 = 1/4 star
   0.34 - 0.66 = 1/2 star
   0.67 - 0.99 = 3/4 star

   renderFractionalStar(remainder) {
     if (remainder < 0.33) {
       return {quarterStar}
     }
    if (remainder < 0.67) {
       return {halfStar}
     }

    if (remainder < 1) {
       return {threeQuarterStar}
     }
   }

3. Fill/Gradient
fill - will fill whole star for whole numbers
